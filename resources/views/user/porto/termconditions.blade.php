           <ul>
               <li>Trip Beyond does not operate as a principal, instead arranging travel-related services with third-party vendors such as airlines, hotels, tour operators, and consolidators (each a "Travel Supplier"), including, but not limited to, air transportation, accommodation, and vehicle rental.
            </li>
            <li>By using this Site, you agree that the rates given by Trip Beyond and associated businesses are the product of an agreement between Trip Beyond and the Travel Suppliers, and that they include some fees retained by them for their services, taxes, and other costs. You allow Trip Beyond and associated businesses to make reservations or enter contracts on your behalf when you book with any Travel Supplier through this Site.
            </li>
            <li>Trip Beyond bears no liability for acts pertaining to travel services that are beyond its or its employees' control, except as specifically specified below. We are not accountable or responsible for any act, error, omission, injury, loss, accident, damage, delay, nonperformance, irregularity, or any other consequence of any Travel Supplier's negligence, default, or other act or inaction. Trip Beyond is not responsible for any pricing changes, schedule changes, equipment changes, or accommodations changes that occur after a trip service has been booked and paid for.
            </li>
            <li>Trip Beyond is not responsible for final currency conversion or rates if paid after a travel reservation for foreign travel products and services is made with us. You accept and recognize that currency values fluctuate, and any given price in local currency on the Site is only a suggestion, not a formal contract between you and the travel supplier or us.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sometimes travel arrangements may be totally non-refundable once booked and paid for, or there may be a penalty for canceling or seeking a refund from the seller of travel items and services. Cancellations and refunds may be subject to a fee once tickets have been issued. We have no control over the prices printed on the tickets.

            </li>
            <li>Concessions may vary based on a variety of criteria such as the airlines used, the level of service provided, the location, the time of year (low, mid, or high season), prior notice given, minimum stay requirements met, and aircraft load.
            </li>
            <li>Other advertiser's items and services advertised on our Site are not guaranteed, endorsed, validated, or promoted by Trip Beyond.
